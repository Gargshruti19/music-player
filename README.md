# Music Player HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Project

This is a simple web-based music player project that allows you to play a song with basic controls. It consists of HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the functionality. You can use this code as a starting point for creating your own music player on your website.

## Project Files

The project includes the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the HTML file that defines the structure of the music player interface. It contains the audio player, song information, and control buttons.

- `style.css`: This CSS file provides the styling for the music player, including the layout, colors, and fonts.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file contains the logic for controlling the audio player, such as play/pause functionality, progress bar, and song duration.

## HTML Structure

- The HTML file defines the basic structure of the music player, including song information (title and artist), an image for the song cover, an audio element for playing the song, and control buttons.

## Styling

- The CSS file styles the music player interface, giving it an attractive and responsive design. It sets the colors, fonts, and layout of the player.

## JavaScript Functionality

- The JavaScript file handles the following functionality:
  - Playing and pausing the song when the play/pause button is clicked.
  - Updating the progress bar in real-time as the song plays.
  - Allowing the user to seek to a specific time in the song by clicking on the progress bar.

## Usage

To use this code on your website, you need to include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your project. Make sure you have the song file (`song.mp3`) and the cover image (`cover.png`) in your project directory. You can customize the song title, artist, and styling according to your preferences.

## Credits

- The code includes the Font Awesome library for the icons used in the player controls.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this music player project to create your own personalized music player for your website.
